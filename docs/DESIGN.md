# Design

All of the observations need to show last known observation date somewhere...

## Planets

* What it's called: Common name
* How I can find it in the sky: current declination and right ascension, decl.
  and r.a. at a specific time; map of the celestial sphere
* How much of the sky it takes up when seen from Earth: angular diameter
* How far away it is: distance (from Earth)
* What its orbit looks like and where it's positioned in space: various
  available orbital parameters and a 3D representation that shows the orbit
  visually from different angles
* How long it takes to complete an orbit around the Sun: sidereal orbital period
* How long between retrograde motions in the night sky: synodic orbital period
* How fast it moves around the orbit: average orbital speed
* Where it is now in orbit: calculation based on time since last perihelion and
  orbital speed
* How much it reflects light: albedo
* How bright it is: apparent magnitude (absolute magnitude isn't appropriate
  since it's not bright enough to see anywhere else)
* The shape of the planet itself: equatorial and polar radii, flattening
  (compared to Earth)
* Consequences of its shape: Surface area, volume
* How fast a spaceship would have to travel to exceed the gravitational pull to
  leave the planet: escape velocity
* How fast it spins relative to the stars: sidereal rotation period (equatorial
  rotation period and magnetic rotation period for gaseous bodies)
* How long a day is relative to an observer on the planet: solar day
* How dense it is: Mass
* How much a spacefarer would weigh on the planet: equatorial surface gravity
* How hot/cold it gets on the surface: Surface temperature, seasons, temperature
  at seasons
* What it's made of: Atmospheric composition, geology / soil composition (if
  applicable)
* Atmospheric pressure
* Notable geographic features?
* Maps of the surface
* Photos taken by various telescopes and satellites
* How many moons (satellites) it has
* Man-made satellites orbiting the planet now or in the past / Rovers traversing
  the planet now or in the past, and their current locations if still applicable

## Moons

* What it's called: Common name, systematic designation (Mars II, etc.)
* When it was discovered and by whom
* How I can find it in the sky: current declination and right ascension, decl.
  and r.a. at a specific time; map of the celestial sphere (TODO: decide if this
  is useful or not)
* How far away it is: distance from the main body
* What its orbit looks like and where it's positioned in space: various
  available orbital parameters and a 3D representation that shows the orbit
  visually from different angles
* How long it takes to make a complete orbit around the main body: sidereal
  orbital period
* How fast it moves around the orbit: average orbital speed
* Where it is now in orbit: calculation based on time since last periapsis and
  orbital speed
* How much it reflects light: albedo
* The shape of the planet itself: equatorial and polar radii (compared to
  Earth)
* Consequences of its shape: Surface area, volume
* How much a spacefarer would weigh on the planet: equatorial surface gravity
* How fast a spaceship would have to travel to exceed the gravitational pull to
  leave the planet: escape velocity
* How fast it spins relative to the stars: sidereal rotation period (a couple of
  moons have a chaotic rotational period and some are synchronous)
* How long a day is relative to an observer on the planet: solar day (if
  possible)
* How dense it is: Mass
* How hot/cold it gets on the surface: Surface temperature, seasons, temperature
  at seasons
* What it's made of: Atmospheric composition, geology / soil composition (if
  applicable)
* Notable geographic features?
* Maps of the surface, if applicable
* Photos taken by various telescopes and satellites
* Man-made satellites in the region now or in the past

## Stars

* What it's called: common name, official names from well-known catalogs
* How I can find it in the sky: declination and right ascension; map of the
  celestial sphere
* How far away it is: distance (from Earth)
* How fast it's moving: radial velocity and proper motion
* How fast it's rotating: rotational velocity
* The shape of the star based on rotation speed (?)
* How bright it is: absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, luminosity
* What type of star it is: stellar classification (where it fits on the HR diagram)
* How hot it is / what color it is: temperature/color (related to type)
* How big it is: diameter (absolute, and compared to Sun)
* How old it is: rough estimate using star type and so forth
* There are several other attributes here not on Simbad for certain stars (e.g.
  Betelgeuse):
  * Metallicity
  * Surface gravity
* The neighborhood: Links to stars in nearby regions (part of a binary star
  system? part of a significant region of space?)
* History: when it was discovered, what significance it has now and in history,
  which catalogs it's been published in over time
* Photos taken by various telescopes and satellites
* Articles in publications mentioning the star
* Informal articles and news mentioning the star

## Comets

* What its orbit looks like and where it's positioned in space: (six parameters)
  eccentricity, periapsis, inclination, angle of the ascending node, argument of
  periapsis, time of perihelion passage; a 3D representation that shows all
  of this visually

## Asteroids

* What its orbit looks like and where it's positioned in space: (six parameters)
  eccentricity, semi-major axis, inclination, angle of the ascending node,
  argument of periapsis, mean anomaly at epoch; a 3D representation that shows
  all of this visually

## Learning

* A model of the celestial sphere and what the ecliptic, Sun, and planets look
  like at different points of the Earth - switch back and forth between top-down
  view of the Solar system, "following" the Earth and then an observer on Earth
  at the equinox and at different latitudes
* What causes the planets to undergo retrograde motion in the sky? (see
  [here][1] for some diagrams)
